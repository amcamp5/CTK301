      <h2> Kinetic Type Video. </h2>
      <p> Last year I took a Digital Media class where for one of my projects I had to create a Kinetic Type Video. A Kinetic Type Video, or "moving text", is an animation technique mixing motion and text to express ideas using video animation. I had originally wanted to do a funny quote with a piece of audio from my favorite TV show The Office! However, I wanted to challenge myself and expand my knowledge on the medium instead of taking the easier option with a twenty second video. So, I decided to do a lyrical video with a song created by one of my favorite artists, Billie Eilish.</p>

    <section class="roundedbox9">
      <p> I have been listening to her music since before she became a mainstream artist, and I thought it would be more fun to create a video with music from an artist who I've loved for some time. It was very difficult picking a song of hers because, honestly, I love them all! Each of her songs generate many different emotions, and they all have their own unique sound. Although it was a tough decision, I chose the title song from her newest album, "Bad Guy". I selected this song because I thought that the beat and rhythm would work very well incoporated into a Kinetic Type Video. I got the chance to use After Effects for the first time with this project, which benefited me in that I learned how to use a new program, and I could make a video of something I love. So, take a look at my Kinetic Type Video, and send a message if you have any feedback for me!
