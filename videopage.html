      <h2> Video. </h2>
      <p> Last year I took a Digital Media class where for one of my projects I had to create a Kinetic Type video using a qoute from a show, a movie or even lyrics from a song. I had originally wanted to do a funny quote and audio from my favorite TV show The Office, however I wanted to challenge myself with more than a 30 second video. So, I decided to use lyrics from a song from one of my favorite artists of this decade, Billie Eilish.</p>

    <section class="roundedbox9">
      <p> I have been listening to her music since before she became a mainstream artist, and I thought it would be more fun to create a video with music from an artist who I've loved for some time. It was very difficult picking a song of hers because, honestly, I love them all! Each of her songs create such different experiences and moments in time, not just more of the same. So, I decided to choose her title song from her newest album, "Bad Guy", because I thought that the beat and rhythm would work very well incoporated into a kinetic type video. I got the chance to use After Effects for the first time with this project, and it was awesome getting a chance to both learn a new program and make a video of something I love. So, take a look at my kinetic type video, and send a message if you have any feedback for me!
