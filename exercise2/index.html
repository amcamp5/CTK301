    <p>This is a portrait poster about wearing
      safety googles with the message provided
      by the WPA Safety Division. A man in a
      black hate and shirt wearing goggles in
      front of the background of a pale yellow.
      Bold dark text creates a pop and holds
      focus to the message along with no
      shading in the poster only simple shapes
      and colors. </p>
