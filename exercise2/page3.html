    <p>This is a poster for the Brookfield
       Zoo with a design of a black panther
       on it. The text that reads "Brookfield
       Zoo" is red and in bold lettering, in
       front of a pale yellow background. The
       panther is in a pouncing position and
       portays closure in that the black shapes
       are slightly seperated to create space
       and the shape of the panther. This is
       also an addition for the Federal Art
       Project as it reads in the bottom right
       corner.  </p>
